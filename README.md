# Honeypot Deployment and Attack Monitoring

**Project Overview**:  
This project involves setting up a Cowrie honeypot on an Ubuntu virtual machine using VirtualBox to simulate a vulnerable system that can be attacked. Logs of attacker behavior will be collected and analyzed to understand common threats.

## Objective
- Deploy a Cowrie honeypot to capture and log malicious SSH login attempts.
- Analyze logs to identify attack patterns and malicious activities.
- Set up monitoring tools like Splunk for advanced log analysis.

## Tools and Technologies Used
- **Cowrie Honeypot**
- **VirtualBox** (for VM setup)
- **Ubuntu** (as the operating system)
- **Splunk** (for log analysis, optional)
